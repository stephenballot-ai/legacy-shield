## Your Data Lives in Frankfurt. It Still Answers to Washington.

You did everything right. You chose a cloud provider with an "EU region." Your files sit on a server in Frankfurt, or Dublin, or Amsterdam. European soil, European electricity, European data center staff.

But the company running that server? American. And that single fact undoes everything.

## What the CLOUD Act Actually Says

In March 2018, the United States passed the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act — the CLOUD Act. It was buried in a 2,232-page spending bill and signed into law with almost no public debate.

Here's what it does in plain English: **any US-based company must hand over customer data to US law enforcement, regardless of where that data is physically stored.**

Not "data stored in the US." *Any* data. Anywhere on Earth.

If you store your will, your insurance policy, or your financial records on AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Dropbox — and the US government issues a warrant — that company is legally obligated to hand it over. Even if the server is in the EU. Even if you're a European citizen. Even if you've never set foot in America.

## "But GDPR Protects Me"

This is the part that drives privacy lawyers to drink.

GDPR — the EU's landmark privacy regulation — says personal data of EU residents cannot be transferred outside the EU without adequate protections. The CLOUD Act says US companies must hand over data regardless of where it's stored.

These two laws directly contradict each other.

In practice, here's what happens: US companies comply with US law first. They might challenge a warrant. They might notify you. But when the Department of Justice pushes, American companies push back with lawyers, not locked doors.

Microsoft actually fought this battle in court. In *United States v. Microsoft Corp.* (2018), they argued they shouldn't have to turn over emails stored in Ireland. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court — and then Congress mooted it by passing the CLOUD Act. Problem solved. For the US government, anyway.

## The "EU Region" Marketing Trick

Every major US cloud provider now offers "EU regions." AWS has data centers in Frankfurt, Dublin, Paris, Stockholm, and Milan. Google Cloud operates in multiple European cities. Microsoft Azure covers most of Western Europe.

They market this as a privacy feature. "Your data stays in Europe." Technically true. Functionally meaningless.

Here's an analogy: imagine you rent a safety deposit box at a bank in Amsterdam. The box is here. The key is here. But the bank is owned by an American company headquartered in Seattle. When the US government knocks, they don't come to Amsterdam. They go to Seattle and say, "Open it."

The box being in Amsterdam doesn't matter. The chain of command runs through the US.

## Who Should Care About This?

If you're reading this thinking, "I'm not a criminal, I have nothing to hide" — this isn't about hiding. It's about control.

**Expats with documents in multiple jurisdictions.** Your will follows one country's laws. Your bank accounts are in another. Your pension info, insurance policies, and medical directives are scattered across three cloud services — all American. A US warrant could expose all of it.

**Business owners with client data.** If you're a ZZP'er or freelancer storing client contracts on Google Drive, you may be violating GDPR without knowing it — because your American cloud provider can't guarantee EU-only access.

**Anyone who values the principle.** You chose to live in Europe, partly because of how the EU approaches privacy. That choice means less if your most important files live on US-controlled infrastructure.

## What "European-Owned Infrastructure" Actually Means

There's a crucial difference between "hosted in Europe" and "owned by a European company."

When your data sits on servers owned and operated by a European company — incorporated in Europe, headquartered in Europe, with no US parent company — the CLOUD Act simply doesn't apply. The US government has no jurisdiction over a German company with no American ties.

This is the difference between:
- **AWS Frankfurt** → American company, US jurisdiction, CLOUD Act applies
- **Hetzner (Germany)** → German company, EU jurisdiction, CLOUD Act doesn't apply

Same continent. Same city, even. Completely different legal reality.

## What Does This Mean for Your Documents?

The documents that matter most — your will, power of attorney, insurance policies, mortgage deeds, medical directives — these are exactly the files that deserve the strongest protection.

Not just encryption. Not just an "EU region" checkbox. Real, structural protection: European-owned infrastructure where no foreign government can compel access.

And even beyond infrastructure: **zero-knowledge encryption** means even the company hosting your data can't read it. Not because they promise they won't. Because they mathematically *can't*. The keys never leave your device.

## The LegacyShield Approach

LegacyShield runs entirely on European-owned infrastructure — Hetzner, headquartered in Germany. No US parent company. No US investors. No CLOUD Act jurisdiction.

Your documents are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before they leave your browser. We don't hold the keys. We couldn't read your files if we wanted to — and no government can compel us to hand over keys we don't have.

This isn't a marketing feature. It's the architecture.

## What You Should Do Today

**Step 1:** Check where your important documents actually live. Google Drive? Dropbox? iCloud? OneDrive? Every one of those is a US company subject to the CLOUD Act.

**Step 2:** Ask yourself — are you comfortable with the US government having a legal pathway to your will? Your medical directives? Your financial records?

**Step 3:** If not, move your most sensitive documents to infrastructure that's structurally beyond that reach. Not just promises. Architecture.

Your digital legacy deserves better than a checkbox that says "EU region."
