## The Digital Afterlife Problem

We spend decades building our digital lives. Photos in Google Photos, important documents in Google Drive, emails spanning years of relationships and business dealings. But here's a question most people never think about: **what actually happens to all of that when you die?**

The answer is more complicated — and more frustrating — than you might expect.

## What Google Offers: Inactive Account Manager

Google does have a built-in tool called **Inactive Account Manager** (IAM). It allows you to specify what should happen to your account after a period of inactivity — typically 3, 6, 12, or 18 months.

You can choose to:
- **Notify trusted contacts** that your account has been inactive
- **Share specific data** (like Drive files or Photos) with those contacts
- **Delete the account** entirely after the timeout

Sounds reasonable, right? But there are significant limitations.

## The Limitations of Google's Approach

### 1. The Waiting Period

Your family has to wait **months** before anything happens. If you pass away unexpectedly, your loved ones could be waiting 3 to 18 months before Google's system even kicks in. During that time, they have no access to critical documents that might be needed for estate proceedings.

### 2. Most People Never Set It Up

Google's Inactive Account Manager is buried deep in account settings. Studies suggest that **fewer than 5% of Google users** have configured it. If you haven't specifically set it up, your family gets nothing automatically.

### 3. No Encryption, No Privacy

When Google shares your data with a trusted contact, it's Google doing the sharing. That means Google has access to everything — they're the intermediary. Your most sensitive documents, personal photos, and private communications all pass through Google's systems unencrypted.

### 4. Limited Control

You can choose which Google services to share, but you can't pick specific files or folders. It's all-or-nothing for each service. Want to share your Drive documents but not your search history? You can choose that. But you can't share only your will and testament from Drive while keeping personal journals private.

### 5. No Legal Framework

Google's data sharing is not a legal transfer of digital assets. In many European countries, **digital inheritance laws are still evolving**, and what Google provides may not satisfy legal requirements for estate administration.

## What Your Family Actually Faces

When someone dies without proper digital estate planning, their family often encounters:

- **Locked accounts** they cannot access, even with a death certificate
- **Critical documents** (insurance policies, property deeds, passwords) trapped behind two-factor authentication
- **Months of bureaucratic process** trying to get Google to release data through their formal deceased user request process
- **Incomplete information** — Google may release some data but not all, and the process varies by country

In the EU, families often need to provide a death certificate, proof of relationship, proof of their own identity, and sometimes even a court order — all just to access a loved one's Google Drive.

## The Three-Step Solution

Instead of relying on big tech companies to handle your digital legacy, you can take control with three simple steps:

### Step 1: Identify Your Critical Documents

Make a list of everything important: wills, insurance policies, property documents, financial account information, login credentials, medical directives, and any other documents your family would need.

### Step 2: Store Them in a Zero-Knowledge Encrypted Vault

Upload your critical documents to a vault that uses **zero-knowledge encryption**. This means your files are encrypted on your device before they ever reach the server. Unlike Google Drive or Dropbox, the vault provider physically cannot see your data — only you and the people you authorize can decrypt it.

### Step 3: Set Up Emergency Access

Designate trusted contacts who can access your vault using a secure unlock mechanism. Unlike Google's months-long waiting period, you control the access conditions. Your loved ones get what they need, when they need it.

## Why LegacyShield Was Built for This
