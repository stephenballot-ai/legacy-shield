## The Call Nobody Prepares For

Your partner dies on a Tuesday morning. By Wednesday, you need to pay the mortgage, buy groceries, and keep the lights on. You walk into ING, ABN AMRO, or Rabobank with the death certificate, expecting to access the joint account — or at least *their* account.

The teller looks at you sympathetically and says: "I'm sorry, the account has been frozen."

This isn't a hypothetical. It happens every single day in the Netherlands. And for expats, it's even worse — because the system was built for people who grew up inside it.

## What Actually Happens: Step by Step

The moment a Dutch bank is notified of a death — usually through the municipality's Basisregistratie Personen (BRP) — they freeze the deceased's accounts. All of them. Savings, checking, joint accounts. Everything stops.

**Here's the timeline most families face:**

**Day 1-3:** The bank freezes all accounts. Direct debits stop. Standing orders cancel. If your mortgage payment was due, it bounces.

**Week 1-2:** You need to arrange a **Verklaring van Erfrecht** (Certificate of Inheritance) through a notaris. This is a legal document that confirms who the heirs are and who's authorized to access the accounts.

**Week 2-8:** The notaris investigates. They check the Centraal Testamentenregister (Central Will Register) for any existing wills, identify all heirs, and prepare the document. This typically takes 4-8 weeks. Sometimes longer.

**Week 8+:** You present the Verklaring van Erfrecht to the bank. They process it — which takes another 1-2 weeks. Finally, the heirs get access.

That's **two to three months** where your family may have no access to the household money.

## The Joint Account Trap

"But we have a joint account," you might think. It doesn't matter as much as you'd expect.

When one account holder dies, Dutch banks typically freeze joint accounts too — or at minimum restrict them so only the surviving holder can access up to a limited amount for daily expenses. The rules vary by bank:

- **ABN AMRO** freezes the account and may grant the surviving partner limited access for household expenses after presenting the death certificate
- **ING** restricts the joint account — the surviving partner may continue to use it with limitations, but the deceased's share is part of the estate
- **Rabobank** requires a Verklaring van Erfrecht before full access is restored, even for joint accounts

None of this is instant. And none of it is simple.

## For Expats: It Gets Worse

If you're an expat in the Netherlands, several things compound the problem:

**Your family doesn't speak Dutch.** The Verklaring van Erfrecht process is conducted entirely in Dutch. The notaris speaks Dutch. The bank correspondence is in Dutch. Government portals are in Dutch.

**Your family may be in another country.** If your next of kin lives in the UK, the US, or anywhere outside the Netherlands, they need to travel here — or find a way to grant power of attorney to someone local. Both take time.

**Cross-border estates are complex.** If you have bank accounts in multiple countries, each country has its own inheritance process. The Dutch Verklaring van Erfrecht doesn't work at a British bank. Your family is now running parallel legal processes across borders.

**The 30% ruling doesn't help.** Your tax advantage was great while you were alive. It has zero bearing on how fast your family can access your money after you die.

## The Real Cost: Not Just Time

Let's talk about money. The Verklaring van Erfrecht costs between **€500 and €1,500+** depending on the complexity of the estate. If there's no will, it costs more because the notaris has to do additional investigation.

Meanwhile, bills pile up:
- Mortgage payments bounce → the bank sends notices
- Health insurance premiums keep getting charged
- Utility bills arrive
- Children's school fees are due
- The funeral costs €5,000-€10,000 on average in the Netherlands

Your surviving partner or family is financially stranded during the hardest weeks of their life.

## What You Can Do Right Now

The good news: this is entirely preventable with 30 minutes of preparation.

### 1. Make a Dutch Will (Testament)

Visit a notaris and create a will. This dramatically speeds up the Verklaring van Erfrecht process because the notaris doesn't have to investigate who the heirs are — it's written down.

Cost: €200-€400 for a basic will. Best investment you'll ever make.

### 2. Know Your Bank's Process

Call your bank today and ask: "What happens to my accounts when I die? What does my partner need to do?" Write down the answers. Each bank is slightly different.

### 3. Store Critical Documents Accessibly

Your family will need:
- Your bank account numbers (IBANs)
- The name and contact details of your notaris
- Your BSN number
- Your will (or confirmation one exists at the Centraal Testamentenregister)
- Life insurance policy details
- Pension fund information
- Mortgage documents

These can't sit in a drawer your family doesn't know about. They can't live in an email account your family can't access. They can't be in a safe deposit box that requires — you guessed it — a Verklaring van Erfrecht to open.

### 4. Tell Someone What to Do

The most important thing you can do is write a simple set of instructions: "When I die, here's what you need to do first, who to call, and where to find everything." Put it somewhere your family can actually access it.
