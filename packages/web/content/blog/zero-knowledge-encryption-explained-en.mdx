## The Illusion of Cloud Security

When you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, you probably assume it's secure. And in a sense, it is — your files are encrypted "in transit" (between your device and the server) and "at rest" (on the server's hard drives).

But here's the critical detail most people miss: **the service provider holds the encryption keys**. That means Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft can technically decrypt and read your files at any time.

For vacation photos, that's probably fine. But for your will, insurance policies, medical directives, or passwords? That's a very different story.

## What Is Zero-Knowledge Encryption?

Zero-knowledge encryption (sometimes called "client-side encryption" or "end-to-end encryption for files") means that **your files are encrypted on your device before they ever leave it**. The encryption key is derived from your password, and the server never sees the key or the unencrypted data.

Here's the key difference:

**Traditional cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive):**
1. You upload a file
2. The service encrypts it on their servers with their key
3. They can decrypt it whenever they want
4. Government requests, data breaches, or rogue employees could expose your data

**Zero-knowledge encryption (LegacyShield):**
1. You upload a file
2. Your browser encrypts it locally using AES-256-GCM with your key
3. Only the encrypted blob reaches the server
4. Nobody — not even us — can read what you stored

## Why This Matters for Sensitive Documents

### Data Breaches Happen to Everyone

In 2012, Dropbox suffered a breach that exposed 68 million user credentials. In 2023, a Microsoft engineer's mistake exposed 38 terabytes of internal data. These companies have billions in security budgets, and they still get breached.

With zero-knowledge encryption, even if our servers were completely compromised, attackers would get nothing but encrypted noise. Your files remain unreadable without your encryption key.

### Government Access and Legal Requests

Cloud providers regularly comply with government data requests. Google's transparency report shows they received over 200,000 government requests for user data in 2023 alone, and they complied with about 75% of them.

With zero-knowledge encryption, we literally cannot comply — not because we choose not to, but because we don't have access to your unencrypted data. We can't hand over what we can't read.

### The Trust Problem

When you store your will on Google Drive, you're trusting:
- Google's security team
- Google's employee access controls
- Google's compliance with privacy laws
- Every government that can issue a request to Google

When you store it in a zero-knowledge vault, you're trusting:
- **Mathematics** — specifically, the AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm that would take billions of years to crack

We think mathematics is more trustworthy than corporate policy.

## The Dropbox Comparison

Let's be specific about what Dropbox offers versus what you actually need:

| Feature | Dropbox | LegacyShield |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Encryption in transit | ✅ TLS | ✅ TLS |
| Encryption at rest | ✅ AES-256 (their key) | ✅ AES-256-GCM (your key) |
| Provider can read files | ⚠️ Yes | ❌ No |
| Survives server breach | ⚠️ Partially | ✅ Fully |
| Emergency access for family | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Built for estate planning | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Government can request data | ⚠️ Yes | ❌ Encrypted only |

Dropbox is a great file-syncing tool. But it was never designed to protect your most sensitive documents or ensure your family can access them when needed.

## How LegacyShield Implements Zero-Knowledge

Here's exactly what happens when you store a document with LegacyShield:

1. **Key derivation**: Your master password is turned into an encryption key using Argon2id — a memory-hard key derivation function that resists brute-force attacks
2. **Local encryption**: Your file is encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM, which provides both confidentiality and integrity
3. **Encrypted upload**: Only the encrypted data is sent to our servers
4. **Storage**: We store the encrypted blob. We never see the key, the original file, or even the file name
5. **Decryption**: When you (or your authorized emergency contact) need the file, it's downloaded and decrypted locally in the browser

At no point does unencrypted data exist on our servers.

## The Bottom Line

If you're storing sensitive documents in Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud, you're trusting a corporation with your most private information. They're probably trustworthy — but "probably" isn't good enough for your will, your medical directives, or the documents your family will need when you're gone.

Zero-knowledge encryption removes the need for trust. Your data is protected by mathematics, not corporate goodwill.
