## The Phone Call Nobody Prepares For

Your father dies on a Tuesday. By Wednesday, you're making funeral arrangements. By Thursday, you realize you need money — his money — to pay for them.

You walk into the bank with the death certificate. You explain the situation. The person behind the counter is sympathetic. They're also completely unhelpful.

"We've frozen the account. You'll need a certificate of inheritance."

That single sentence starts a process that will consume the next three to nine months of your life.

## The Freeze Happens Instantly

The moment a bank learns an account holder has died, they lock everything. Current accounts, savings accounts, joint accounts (in many countries), credit cards — all frozen. Direct debits stop. Standing orders cancel.

This isn't cruelty. It's legally required. The bank needs to protect the estate from unauthorized withdrawals until the rightful heirs are established.

But here's what nobody tells you: the bills don't freeze with the account.

The mortgage payment bounces. The electricity bill goes unpaid. The care home sends a reminder, then a warning, then a collections notice. Your mother's health insurance premium fails, and her coverage enters a grace period she doesn't know about.

You're grieving. And now you're also in a bureaucratic emergency.

## The Paperwork Gauntlet

To unfreeze the account, you typically need:

1. **A death certificate** — Takes 3-10 business days in most EU countries. Sometimes longer if the death occurred abroad.
2. **A certificate of inheritance** (or equivalent) — This is where the nightmare begins.

In the Netherlands, you need a *verklaring van erfrecht* from a notary. Cost: €500 to €1,500+. Timeline: 4 to 12 weeks. The notary has to research whether a will exists, identify all heirs, and prepare a legal document that banks will accept.

In Germany, an *Erbschein* from the probate court. Timeline: 4 to 8 weeks if uncontested. If there's a dispute? Months. Sometimes over a year.

In France, the *notaire* handles succession — and France has mandatory waiting periods. You might wait 6 months before distributions happen by default.

In the UK, you need a Grant of Probate. Average processing time in 2025: 8 to 12 weeks, and that's *after* you've submitted the application.

3. **Identification for all heirs** — Every person named in the inheritance needs to be identified and verified.
4. **The will** — If one exists. If you can find it.

## The Will Nobody Can Find

Here's a scenario that plays out thousands of times a year across Europe:

Dad told you he had a will. He said it was "with the notary" or "in the safe" or "on the computer." You check. It's not where he said. You check his email — locked behind a password you don't have, protected by two-factor authentication on a phone that's now off. You check his filing cabinet and find documents from 2003 that aren't relevant anymore.

Without the will, the estate follows intestacy laws. That might be fine — or it might mean his assets get distributed in a way he never intended. His new partner gets nothing. His estranged child gets a mandatory share. The process takes even longer because there's nothing to guide it.

If you *can* find the will, you're lucky. But most families spend weeks searching, contacting notaries, checking registries, and hoping.

## Real Stories From the Trenches

These aren't hypothetical. They're from public forums, consumer complaint boards, and inheritance advice threads:

**"My mother died in November. It's now May and we still can't access her savings account."** — A poster on a Dutch consumer forum, describing the verklaring van erfrecht process.

**"Dad had accounts at three different banks. Each one required the original certificate of inheritance. We had one copy. They wouldn't accept scans."** — A Reddit user in Germany describing the Erbschein merry-go-round.

**"The bank told us they'd release funds for the funeral. Then they asked for a court order to release the funds for the funeral."** — From a UK probate advice thread.

**"It took us 11 months. Eleven months to get our own mother's money. She had €40,000 in savings and we were borrowing money for groceries."** — A French family describing the succession process.

## Why It Takes So Long

Banks aren't trying to be difficult (mostly). The system is designed this way because:

- **Fraud protection** — Banks need to verify heirs are legitimate. Without due diligence, anyone could claim a dead person's money.
- **Legal liability** — If a bank releases funds to the wrong person, they're liable. So they err on the side of delay.
- **Multiple jurisdictions** — If the deceased was an expat, their assets might fall under multiple countries' laws. This multiplies the complexity.
- **Contested estates** — Even when there's a will, family disputes can freeze everything in court.

Understanding the *why* doesn't pay your bills. But it does explain why "just go to the bank" isn't a solution.

## What You Can Do Right Now

You can't change the system. But you can make sure your family doesn't enter it blind.

### 1. Know Where Everything Is

Your family needs to know — at minimum — which banks you use, which accounts exist, and roughly what's in them. Not your passwords. Just the map.

### 2. Keep Critical Documents Accessible

Your will, insurance policies, pension information, mortgage documents — these shouldn't be in a drawer your family can't find, on a hard drive they can't access, or in an email account locked behind 2FA.

### 3. Have a Financial Buffer Conversation

Who pays the bills if you die tomorrow? If the answer involves accessing your accounts, that's not a plan. Consider joint accounts for household expenses, separate life insurance for immediate costs, or at minimum, make sure someone knows what's due and when.

### 4. Store It Somewhere Your Family Can Actually Reach

This is what [LegacyShield](https://legacyshield.eu) was built for. It's an encrypted document vault where you store the things your family would need — and they can access it using an unlock phrase when the time comes.

No waiting for probate. No searching through drawers. No calling banks that won't talk to them. The documents are there, encrypted with zero-knowledge security, and accessible when it matters most.

## The Six Months You Can Prevent

Nobody thinks about bank account access when they're healthy. It feels morbid, unnecessary, like planning for a reality that's decades away.

But every person described in this article thought the same thing. Their families are the ones who paid the price — in time, in stress, in money borrowed against an inheritance that might take a year to arrive.

The process of accessing a dead person's bank account is broken. You can't fix it. But you can make sure your family has what they need to survive it.
