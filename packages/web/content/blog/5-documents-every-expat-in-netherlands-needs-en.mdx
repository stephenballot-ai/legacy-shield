## Why Expats Need Extra Preparation

Living in the Netherlands as an expat is an incredible experience. But it also means navigating a complex web of documents across multiple countries. When something unexpected happens, your family — potentially in another country — needs to access critical Dutch paperwork they may not even know exists.

Here are the five documents every expat in the Netherlands should have securely stored and accessible to their loved ones.

## 1. Your Will (Testament) — Both Dutch and Home Country

If you own property, have a Dutch bank account, or have children registered in the Netherlands, you likely need a **Dutch will** in addition to any will from your home country. Dutch succession law applies to assets located in the Netherlands, and without a clear will, the default Dutch intestacy rules kick in — which may not align with your wishes.

**What to store:** A copy of your Dutch testament (from the notaris), your home country will, and any codicils or amendments.

**Why it matters:** Without both wills accessible, your family could face months of legal proceedings in two different countries.

## 2. Verklaring van Erfrecht (Certificate of Inheritance)

The **Verklaring van Erfrecht** is a uniquely Dutch document issued by a notaris that confirms who the legal heirs are. Banks, insurers, and government agencies in the Netherlands won't release assets without it.

**What to store:** If you've already obtained one for a previous inheritance, store it. More importantly, store instructions for your family on how to obtain one — including which notaris to contact.

**Why it matters:** Your family abroad may have never heard of this document. Without guidance, they'll be navigating the Dutch legal system blind.

## 3. BSN and DigiD Information

Your **BSN (Burgerservicenummer)** is your Dutch citizen service number — it's needed for virtually everything official. Your **DigiD** is the digital authentication system used to access Dutch government services.

**What to store:** Your BSN number, DigiD login details (or recovery information), and instructions for accessing key government portals like MijnOverheid and MijnBelastingdienst.

**Important caveat:** DigiD is strictly personal and cannot legally be used by someone else. However, your family needs to know about its existence to work with authorities. Store information about what services are tied to your DigiD so your family knows what to follow up on.

## 4. Dutch Health Insurance Policy (Zorgverzekering)

Health insurance is mandatory in the Netherlands, and your policy may include coverage details, dental plans, and additional packages that need to be cancelled or claimed after death.

**What to store:** Your health insurance policy number, provider name, any additional coverage details, and contact information. If you have a employer-provided collective policy, include those details too.

**Why it matters:** Ongoing premiums will continue to be charged. Your family needs to cancel the policy promptly and may be entitled to claim reimbursements.

## 5. Dutch Bank Account Details and Pension Information

If you have a Dutch bank account (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank, etc.), your family will need account details to manage your finances. If you've worked in the Netherlands, you've likely built up a **Dutch pension** through your employer and through AOW (the state pension).

**What to store:** Bank account numbers (IBAN), bank contact details, pension fund names and member numbers, any correspondence about your pension entitlements, and information about your 30% ruling if applicable.

**Why it matters:** Dutch pensions don't automatically transfer to foreign bank accounts. Your family needs to actively claim any entitlements, and the process is entirely in Dutch.

## The Expat-Specific Challenge

The fundamental problem for expats is **distance and unfamiliarity**. Your parents in London, your sister in Sydney, or your partner's family in Berlin may need to navigate Dutch bureaucracy they've never encountered. They may not speak Dutch. They may not know what a notaris is, or that the Verklaring van Erfrecht exists.

That's why simply having these documents isn't enough — they need to be **stored securely and accessibly** with clear instructions.
